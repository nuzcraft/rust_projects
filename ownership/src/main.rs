fn main() {
    // rust doesn't have a garbage collector, so it relies on ownership
    // to manage memory correctly

    //OWNERSHIP RULES
    // 1. Each value in Rust has a variable that's called its owner
    // 2. There can only be one owner at a time
    // 3. When the owner goes out of scope, the value will be dropped

    // Variable scope
